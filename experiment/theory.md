An inductor (L), capacitor (C), and resistor (R) are linked in series in the electrical
<br>circuit, which is powered by an AC voltage supply. The alternating voltage V is
<br>supplied by the voltage source, where
<br>V=Vm sin(ωt)
<br>where,
<br>● Vm is the amplitude of the applied voltage, and
<br>● ω is the frequency of the applied voltage.
<br>If q is the charge on the capacitor and I is the current flowing in the circuit at any
<br>moment t, the voltage equation for the circuit can be written as follows:
<br>Net EMF across the circuit: V (source voltage) = Voltage drop across resistor +
<br>Voltage drop across capacitor + Self-induced Faraday’s emf in the inductor
<br>V=L(di/dt) + IR + q/C
<br>The inductor’s self-inductance is denoted by L.
<br>Substituting alternating voltage for the expression,
<br>Vm sin(ωt) = L(di/dt) + IR + q/C …..(1)
<br>Let us use the analytical method to determine the instantaneous current I or its
<br>matching phase to the applied alternating voltage V. We know that current is
<br>equal to the rate at which electric charge flows per unit of time, i.e.,
<br>I=dq/dt
<br>Differentiating both sides with respect to time, we get:
<br>dI/dt=d
<br>2q/dt
<br>2
<br>The voltage equation in terms of q is obtained by substituting the above value
<br>into equation (1):
<br>Vm sin(ωt) = L(d
<br.2q/dt
<br>2
<br>) + (dq/dt)R + q/C ……(2)
<br>The equation for a forced or damped harmonic oscillator is similar to this
<br>equation. q = qm sin(ωt+θ)
<br>Differentiating both sides with respect to time,
<br>dq/dt = qm ωcos(ωt+θ)
<br>d
<br>2q/dt
<br>2=–qm ω2sin(ωt+θ)
<br>Substituting these values in equation (2),
<br>Vm sin(ωt) = qmω [Rcos(ωt+θ) + (XC–XL)sin(ωt+θ)] …..(3)
<br>Here,
<br>● Capacitive reactance: XC=1/ωC
<br>● Inductive reactance: XL=ωL
